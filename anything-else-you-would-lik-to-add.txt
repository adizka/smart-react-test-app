1) Would be great to HTML make-up for mobile view
2) Would rewrite everything using TypeScript, with Strong Static Typing
3) With TypeScript, we would be able to up abstraction level for some core types. For example, would add 'RoomType' interface, cause rooms could be not only Premium/Economy but VIP/Elit/President/Lux and so on.
4) Right now we able to count only one exact accommodation case. Would add accommodations counting select by Date (with DatePicker in the view part, and fetching from server).
4) Would add input mask to RoomsCount
5) Would add a Print version with downloads in PDF
6) Other things like Authorization/Localization/RTL version.
